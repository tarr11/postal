Views: Text, Html

@* See that last "header" just above? That is how to create an email with multiple alternative views. 
   This view is called "Multipart.cshtml", so the alternative views will be called
   "Multipart.Text.cshtml" and "Multipart.Html.cshtml".

   So we have no actual body defined here - it's all in the alternative views.
